retriever.py
────────────
Single entry point for the chatbot. Handles:

  1. Intent classification  — which collection(s) to query
  2. Retrieval              — HNSW / ChromaDB corpus / intelligence / delta
  3. Conflict detection     — multi-version chunks for the same section
  4. Delta injection        — auto-pulls delta report when conflict detected
  5. Context formatting     — normal or version-split layout
  6. System prompt          — returns the right LLM instruction set

Smart routing logic
───────────────────
  specific    →  HNSW hierarchical (fastest, most precise)
                 → if empty, widen to corpus
                 → if reranked confidence < CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD, pull in
                   sibling sub-parents under the SAME routed parent(s)
                   (chords in the same key, not a jump to another song) —
                   see router.py:Router.expand_siblings
                 → if STILL below threshold, bridge to a different parent
                   family entirely (the "key change") — see
                   router.py:Router.expand_cross_parent
  factual     →  ChromaDB corpus
  intelligence →  ChromaDB intelligence (summaries/overviews)
  delta       →  ChromaDB delta

  POST-RETRIEVAL (any path):
    if chunks from multiple versions cover the same section
      → conflict detected
      → query delta collection with the conflicting section name
      → format context in versioned layout
      → return versioned system prompt
